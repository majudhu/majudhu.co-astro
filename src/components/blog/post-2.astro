        That was not the 2020 that was promised. But few things like renewable
        energy becoming even more efficient and mainstream, more people taking
        climate change seriously and Microsoft brings to table C# 8.0 and .NET
        5.
        <br />
        I have always been a fan of functional style and concise syntax. Reason Why
        I dislike Java and C#, fell in love with Rust on first sight. My current
        project at work is about scrpting to maintain database backups and such.
        So here I am writing a shell script in C# on WPF GUI. One of the features
        I got blown away was they added using statements, and hence no need to block
        and nest it. Now that lambda expressions and async/await is supported in
        the common APIs. It let me write more in my preferred way. What actually
        blew me off my chair was IAsyncDisposable, and it exisiting in the libraries
        I had used in this project. And the most satisfying moment was most of the
        early lines in my methods started with
        <br />await using var <br />await using var <br />await using var
