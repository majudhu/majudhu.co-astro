        Is age 26 the magic number? The entire year has been a rollercoaster. By
        the start of the year everything has been going smoothly. Making
        websites has become the daily chore. I had become proficient with the
        current most popular stack React, Next and tailwindcss. Additionally,
        good enough with MongoDB and Mongoose to know my way around as a
        full-stack web developer.

        With enough confidence I finally started doing freelance projects too.
        Everything was marvelous. I was coding all day, every day. Things were
        getting better and better day by day. Not to mention in the most
        onforseen way I was offered a new job. To work on one of the greatest
        web projects of the government, with an amazing team. Finally caught
        with the dream to work in a team and with high skilled developers around
        here. I wouldn't even have imagined myself working with such a high
        paycheck. Well things were going too fast, working 2 jobs and
        freelancing, I wasn't able to manage it. Some freelance projects had to
        be dropped. Social time had to be restricted. Nevertheless, it was good
        to finally be financially stable and providing to those that supported
        me upto here.

        Mid year and more rollercoaster rides on steroids. My old Zenbook 3's
        display was failing. I was just barely able to afford to buy a new
        laptop. My plan was to buy the new M1 MacBook Air and later buy a good
        gaming desktop PC. Even more surprises as my new employer provided me
        with an M1 MacBook Pro as their work machine. Not to mention personal
        gaols I had lost hope of happened. Even learnt Typescript as the new job
        requires.

        In all this action, had an accident playing with my niece at the park,
        sprained my ankle, breaking a bone. So I have been locked up in home
        with plaster on my lower leg, for 2 weeks, and 3 more weeks to go.
        Certain aspiring things happened recently that kept me happy and
        motivated. Hence all these time I made sure to spend few hours each day
        learning. Scrolling Twitter, Reddit and YouTube, consuming any valuable
        material. Added with the expertise I receive from my co-workers I could
        now brag myself being an expert javascript/react/front-end web
        developer. In the two weeks stuck at home, I have gone through Remix,
        Prisma, Fly.io, Docker build, SvelteKit, Solid, Astro, Deno and Fresh.
        Its 3am and I have just completed rewriting my website in Astro and
        Tailwind, and wrote this blog post. ðŸ¥³ ðŸš€
