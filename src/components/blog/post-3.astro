        So I decided to start fresh again. New job, new apartment. Not that
        anything was wrong about the old job. Nice and friendly people. For me
        work was where I was at most peace, away from the life's hardness and my
        despairs. Keeping my mind away from the bad thoughts that haunt me. I
        got an offer to do what I hated the second most. Front-end web
        development. Well, my last job was mostly about doing what I hated the
        most, mobile app dev. And here I am, a Flutter guru. Let's tackle on my
        weakest coding skill. Gambling for a better life.

        ps. I will never forget my first job as a software developer at Sorting
        Company. They will forever be the people who hired me when no one else
        did.
