  <Paragraph>
    So I decided to start fresh again. New job, new apartment. Not that anything
    was wrong about the old job. Nice and friendly people. For me work was where
    I was at most peace, away from the life's hardness and my despairs. Keeping
    my mind away from the bad thoughts that haunt me. I got an offer to do what
    I hated the second most. Front-end web development. Well, my last job was
    mostly about doing what I hated the most, mobile app dev. And here I am, a
    Flutter guru. Let's tackle on my weakest coding skill. Gambling for a better
    life.

    ps. I will never forget my first job as a software developer at Sorting
    Company. They will forever be the people who hired me when no one else did.
