  <Paragraph>
    That was not the 2020 that was promised. But few things like renewable
    energy becoming even more efficient and mainstream, more people taking
    climate change seriously and Microsoft brings to table C# 8.0 and .NET 5.
    <br />
     I have always been a fan of functional style and concise syntax. Reason Why
    I dislike Java and C#, fell in love with Rust on first sight. My current
    project at work is about scripting to maintain database backups and such. So
    here I am writing a shell script in C# on WPF GUI. One of the features I got
    blown away with, was they added using statements, and hence no need to block
    and nest it. Now that lambda expressions and async/await is supported in the
    common APIs. It let me write more in my preferred way. What actually blew me
    off my chair was IAsyncDisposable, and it existing in the libraries I had
    used in this project. And the most satisfying moment was most of the early
    lines in my methods started with
    <br />await using var <br />await using var <br />await using var
